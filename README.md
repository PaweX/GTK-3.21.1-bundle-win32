# GTK+ 3.21.1 bundle win32
I've compiled that just for tests - there is a warning in the console output while using application with this gtk+ bundle. The code of the libraries wasn't changed:

(gtk3-demo-application.exe:6420): GLib-GObject-WARNING **
losure->va_marshal (002A7240) with new marshal (009DAC5E)

I don't know why the warning appears.

This GTK+ was built with the newest libraries of all dependencies at the build time.

I used these binaries to create some programs that use GTK+.
