# GTK 3.21.1 bundle win32
I've compiled that just for tests - there are warnings in the console output while using application with this gtk+ bundle. The code of the libraries wasn't changed.

A few .exe files in the bin folder might be missing due to compilation issues. However it doesn't cause any problems when GTK+ library is used.
